#We recommend using a white background for the terminal so that the colors come out nicely.
#This program contains a dictionary of periodic table, including each element's name, symbol, number and weight. It can display other traits of that element if you enter one of the information. It can also add the weights together and give you the weight of a molecule when you enter its formula.
