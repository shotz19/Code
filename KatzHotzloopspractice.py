''' Instructions:
   Work with a partner to complete these tasks. Assume that all variables mentioned in the description are declared and initialized; however, feel free to use additional variable as necessary (please avoid extra variables, though; don't use them unless you must to store a required value or simplify your code.) Write your solution below the commented description.
'''

''' 1. 
   Write a for loop that will print out all the integers from 0-4 in ascending order. 
'''
for i in range(5):
    print(i)

''' 2. 
   Write a for loop that will print out all the integers from 0-4 in descending order.
'''

'''
for i in range(-5, 6, 1):
  print(i)

''' 5. 
   Write two for loops that will both print out odd numbers from 25 to 49. The loops themselves must be different, but they will have the same output.
'''

''' 9. 
   A girl in your class has jellybeans in a jar. The number of jellybeans is stored in int beans. Every day she shares one jellybean with every student in the class, and she herself takes two. The number of students in the class is held in variable students (int). Write a loop that determines how many days it will take for her to run out of jellybeans.

''' 12. 
   A flying car can travel an average of 96mph. Write a loop that will determine how long it will take you (to the nearest quarter hour) to get to your destination if you were to travel by flying car. The distance to your destination is stored in distance (int).
'''

   "1/2 = .5" "1/3 = .666666666667" etc.
'''
for i in range(21):
  print("1/"+number+" = "(1/number))


''' 18. 
   Write a loop that determines the sum of all the numbers from 1-100, as well as the average. Store the sum in variable total (int) and the average in variable avg (float).
'''
for i in range(101):

   A friend tells you that PI can be computed with the following equation:
   PI = 4 * (1-1/3+1/5-1/7+1/9-1/11+1/13-1/15...)
   Write a loop that will calculate this output for n-iterations of the pattern (n being an int), that could help you determine if your friend is right or wrong.

''' 20. 
   A mother rabbit can have a litter of rabbits every month. In the litter, the number of rabbits can vary from 1 to 14 babies per litter, half of which are females. Rabbits can start reproducing at 6 months, so let's add all the new rabbits from the year to the reproductive pool at the end of each year (when their average age is 6 months). Write a simulation that will show how many rabbits will exist at the end of 5 years, starting with just one mother rabbit. 
'''

''' 22. 
   Write a loop which prints the numbers 1 to 110, 11 numbers per line. The program shall print "Coza" in place of the numbers which are multiples of 3, "Loza" for multiples of 5, "Woza" for multiples of 7, "CozaLoza" for multiples of 3 and 5, and so on. Sample output:
